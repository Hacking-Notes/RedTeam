<h2>Overview</h2>

- The reason we need "system info" is because there are specific kernel exploits depending on the Windows build.
- If we own the Kernel, we own the system - that's what we are trying to do.

<h2>Manual Kernel Exploitation (Devel - HTB)</h2>

1. Search for the specific kernel exploit in Google
- ms10-015 doesn't work because we don't have GUI access
- so keep working through them & researching each one
- Rest of example is with MS10-059 (chimichurri exploit)

2. Downloaded the .exe to attacking machine

3. Set up Python HTTP server on attacking machine to host the file for victim to download

4. Go to temp folder (likely have write access here)
