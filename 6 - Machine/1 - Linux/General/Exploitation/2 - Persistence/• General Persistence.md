<h2>What is Persistence</h2>

Persistence in hacking refers to the ability of an attacker to maintain control over a compromised system or to maintain access to it even after a reboot or after the attacker has logged out. This can be accomplished through a variety of methods, such as installing a rootkit, creating a new account with administrator privileges, modifying system settings or modifying the boot process. The goal of persistence is to allow an attacker to remain undetected on a system and to maintain access to it over an extended period of time. It is an important aspect of many advanced persistent threats (APTs), where the attacker is attempting to infiltrate a system and remain there for a long period of time without being detected.
