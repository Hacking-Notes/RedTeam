MMC (Microsoft Management Console) can be used to enumerate and gather more information about the active directory (through a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) session)

- More infomration about MMc
	The Microsoft Management Console (MMC) can be used to enumerate information about the active directory, which is a database that stores information about a computer network's user accounts, security policies, and other network objects. By using MMC snap-ins, such as the Active Directory Users and Computers snap-in, an administrator can view and manage the active directory.
	ㅤ
	An attacker could potentially use MMC to enumerate information about the active directory for the purpose of exploitation. For example, an attacker could use MMC to gather information about user accounts, security groups, and other objects in the active directory. This information could be used to plan and execute an attack on the network, such as attempting to gain unauthorized access to network resources or to elevate their own privileges within the network.
	ㅤ
	To open the MMC, click the Start button, type "run" into the search box, and then press Enter. Once run is open, type mmc and press enter to get in the MMC

Benefits

-   The GUI provides an excellent method to gain a holistic view of the AD environment.
-   Rapid searching of different AD objects can be performed.  
    
-   It provides a direct method to view specific updates of AD objects.
-   If we have sufficient privileges, we can directly update existing AD objects or add new ones.

Drawbacks

-   The GUI requires RDP access to the machine where it is executed.
-   Although searching for an object is fast, gathering AD wide properties or attributes cannot be performed.
