<h2>Initial Enumeration of the Domain</h2>

Context/Setting:
	In the following context, we are on a local network (172.0.0.1)

- Key Data Points
	- **AD Users**                                      ---> Enumerate valid user account we can target for password spaying
	- **Ad Joined Computer**                   ---> Key computers include domain controllers, file servers, web servers, exchange mail servers, database servers, ...
	- **Key Services**                                ---> Kerberos, NetBIOS, LDAP, DNS
	- **Vulnerable Host and Services**    ---> Anything that can be a quick win (Easy host to exploit and gain a foothold)


Fping (Replace Nmap  to simply verify what IP are active)
```
fping -asgq LOCAL-IP/23
```

- -a                    ---> Show all of the hosts that are responding
- -q                    ---> Suppress the display of the individual ping results for each host.
- /23                  ---> A subnet mask of /23 (e.g. 192.168.0.1/23) specifies that the network includes all IP addresses from 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.1.254. (Specific to this example)


Nmap Scan
```
nmap -iL /path/to/file.txt -p-                          ---> Can add --min-rate=9856
nmap -sC -sV -iL /path/to/file.txt -p PORTS-FOUND       ---> Can add --min-rate=9856
```
