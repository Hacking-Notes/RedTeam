<h2>Additional Persistence Techniques</h2>

-   **[Skeleton keys](https://stealthbits.com/blog/unlocking-all-the-doors-to-active-directory-with-the-skeleton-key-attack/) -** Using Mimikatz, we can deploy a skeleton key. Mimikatz created a default password that will work for any account in the domain. Normal passwords will still work, making it hard to know that this attack has taken place. This default password can be used to impersonate any account in the domain.  
    
-   **[Directory Service Restore Mode (DSRM)](https://adsecurity.org/?p=1714) -** Domain controllers have an internal break glass administrator account called the DSRM account. This password is set when the server is promoted to a DC and is seldom changed. This password is used in cases of emergencies to recover the DC. An attacker can extract this password using Mimikatz and use this password to gain persistent administrative access to domain controllers in the environment.  
    
-   **[Malicious Security Support Provider (SSP)](https://adsecurity.org/?p=1760) -** Exploiting the SSP interface, it is possible to add new SSPs. We can add Mimikatz's mimilib as an SSP that would log all credentials of authentication attempts to a file. We can specify a network location for logging, which would allow mimilib to send us credentials as users authenticate to the compromised host, providing persistence.  
    
-   **[Computer Accounts](https://adsecurity.org/?p=2753)** **-** The passwords for machine accounts are normally rotated every 30 days. However, we can alter the password of a machine account which would stop the automatic rotation. Together with this, we can grant the machine account administrative access to other machines. This will allow us to use the computer account as a normal account, with the only sign of the persistence being the fact that the account has administrative rights over other hosts, which is often normal behaviour in AD, so that it may go undetected.
