Signature-based detection is a method used by antivirus software to identify malware by searching for known patterns or "signatures" in the code of a file or program. These signatures are unique sequences of code or other identifying characteristics that are specific to a particular type of malware.

When a file or program is scanned by antivirus software, the software compares the code in the file to a database of known malware signatures. If the code matches a signature in the database, the antivirus software will flag the file as malware and take appropriate action, such as quarantining or deleting the file to prevent it from causing harm to the system.
