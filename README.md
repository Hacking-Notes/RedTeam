## Information

Below, you'll find a breakdown of the hacking methodology and various hacking techniques that is included in my notes:

- Starting with information gathering, you'll find techniques and tools for gathering information about a target system or network, such as reconnaissance and footprinting. This information can then be used to identify potential vulnerabilities and plan your attack.

- Moving on to scanning and enumeration, you'll learn about the various methods used to map out a target network, including port scanning and network mapping. These techniques allow you to identify open ports, running services, and other information that can help you identify potential vulnerabilities.

- In the section on web hacking, you'll find information on various types of injection vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, command injection, and cross-site scripting (XSS). You'll learn about the mechanics of these attacks, as well as how to detect and prevent them.

- The exploitation section of the repository covers techniques for taking advantage of vulnerabilities in order to gain unauthorized access to a target system. This may involve techniques such as buffer overflows, privilege escalation, or other methods of compromising a system.

- Finally, you'll find information on windows and linux hacking, including techniques for exploiting vulnerabilities in these popular operating systems. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced hacker, you'll find valuable information and resources in this repository to help you improve your skills and better understand the world of ethical hacking.
