<h2>Manual Search</h2>

- Check the source code for any comments that may contain sensitive information, such as login credentials or server information.

- Review the `robots.txt` file to see which parts of the website are disallowed to be crawled by search engines. This can reveal hidden pages or directories that may be interesting to explore further.

- Check for the existence of a `sitemap.xml` file, which can provide an overview of the structure and organization of the website, including links to all of the pages on the site. This can be useful for identifying areas of the website that may be vulnerable to attack.
