<h3>What is Google dorking?</h3>

Google dorking, also known as Google hacking or Google search hacking, is a technique used by security professionals to identify potential security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in web applications.

It involves using advanced search operators in Google search queries to find specific information that is not easily accessible through normal search methods. This information can include sensitive files, directories, login pages, vulnerable scripts, and other confidential data that can be used for malicious purposes if accessed by unauthorized users.
