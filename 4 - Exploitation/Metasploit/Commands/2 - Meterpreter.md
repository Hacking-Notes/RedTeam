- Meterpreter Migration Shell

	Migrating to another process will help Meterpreter interact with it. For example, if you see a word processor running on the target (e.g. word.exe, notepad.exe, etc.), you can migrate to it and start capturing keystrokes sent by the user to this process. Some Meterpreter versions will offer you the `keyscan_start`, `keyscan_stop`, and `keyscan_dump` command options to make Meterpreter act like a keylogger. Migrating to another process may also help you to have a more stable Meterpreter session. If you migrate in process id of browser, it might even be possible to inject elements in the web page.

	To migrate the session, you can use the `migrate` command and specify the PID of the target process. For example, if you wanted to migrate the session to the process with PID 1234, you would use the following command:

	The migrate command
	```shell-session
	- meterpreter > migrate 1234
	[*] Migrating from 1304 to 1234...
	[*] Migration completed successfully.
	meterpreter >
	```

	When you migrate the session to a different process, the payload is injected into the target process and begins executing within its context. This means that the payload is now running within the same process as the target process, and has the same privileges and access to resources as the target process. We can think about this has both PID that fuse together!

	Be careful; you may lose your user privileges if you migrate from a higher privileged (e.g. SYSTEM) user to a process started by a lower privileged user (e.g. webserver). You may not be able to gain them back.
