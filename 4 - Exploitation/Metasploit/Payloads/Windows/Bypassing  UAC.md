<h2>What is Bypassing UAC</h2>

Bypassing User access Control – Adversaries may bypass UAC mechanisms to elevate process privileges on the system. Windows User Account Control (UAC) allows a program to elevate its privileges (tracked as integrity levels ranging from low to high) to perform a task under administrator-level permissions, possibly by prompting the user for confirmation.
