Using the target machine
```
# From the attacker’s host machine, we can use curl with the internal Docker IP to show that the web application is running, and the socks proxy works
$ curl --proxy socks4a://localhost:9050 http://172.17.0.1 -v

… etc …

# From the attacker’s host machine, we can use ProxyChains to scan the compromised host machine for common ports
$ proxychains -q nmap -n -sT -Pn -p 22,80,443,5432 172.17.0.1
