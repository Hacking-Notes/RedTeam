<h2>Linux -> Windows</h2>

Establishing a shell or reverse shell connection between Linux and Windows machines can be complex due to incompatible shells and commands. However, it's possible with the right knowledge and tools. Use SSH to connect to a remote Windows machine from a Linux machine and run commands. The Windows machine needs an SSH server installed. For reverse shell connection, use Plink to initiate a connection from Windows to Linux. Alternatively, use ASPX shell with a Windows machine as an intermediary host, but this approach requires specific Windows tools and techniques and may not be reliable.
