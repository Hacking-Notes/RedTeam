<h2>Linux -> Linux</h2>

Establishing a shell or reverse shell connection between two Linux machines is simple since they use the same type of shell and similar commands. Use SSH to connect to a remote machine and run commands on it. Use the ssh command on the attacking machine to initiate the connection and authenticate with the target machine. To establish a reverse shell connection, the target machine initiates the connection to the attacking machine and runs commands on it. This can be helpful when the target machine has limited connectivity or is behind a firewall. As long as both machines have compatible shells and necessary tools, establishing a connection between them is not a concern.
