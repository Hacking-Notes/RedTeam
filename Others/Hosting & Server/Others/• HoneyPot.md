<h2>What is a HoneyPot</h2>

 A cyber honeypot works in a similar way, baiting a trap for hackers. It's a sacrificial computer system that’s intended to attract cyberattacks, like a decoy. It mimics a target for hackers, and uses their intrusion attempts to gain information about cybercriminals and the way they are operating or to distract them from other targets.
